Windows Mail and previous versions of Microsoft Outlook required using HTML tables for layout and lacked support for many basic CSS properties. They required arcane coding practices. This guide does not provide information on developing for Windows Mail or older versions of Outlook. 

Windows Mail is being [discontinued](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/outlook-for-windows-the-future-of-mail-calendar-and-people-on-windows-11-715fc27c-e0f4-4652-9174-47faa751b199).
