## Which image formats are supported?

All email clients support png and jpg. Most support AVIF.

:::danger[Do not use SVG or WebP]
SVG and WebP are not well supported in email clients.
:::
## Animated images ('gifs')
For animated images (effectively video without audio), `.gif` is universally supported.

:::caution[gif is an old legacy format]
gif images have a large file size and bad visual fidelity
:::

Animated AVIF is a modern image format that offers a far smaller file size and improved visual quality compared to gif. Check the support data on [Can I Email](https://www.caniemail.com/search/?s=avif) before deciding to use this format.

Other animated image formats (animated WebP, animated PNG) are not well supported and should not be used.

## Optimise your images
Run your images through a tool like Squoosh or TinyPNG to reduce the file size.
